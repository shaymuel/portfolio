    <h1>Week 10 Notes</h1>
    <p>This week I spent the majority of my time working on the Group Assignment and the Challenge 2.</p>
    <a href="teamActivity/index.html">
        <h2>Week 10 Team Activity</h2>

    <h2>CLIENT-SIDE VALIDATION</h2>
    <p>Client-side form validation help ensure data submitted matches the requirements set forth in the various form
        controls. Users can fix client-side validation right away if something is not input correctly. Validation done
        on the server is called server-side validation. Data passed from the client to the server should never be
        trusted.</p>
    <p><strong>Built-in Validation Attributes</strong></p>
    <p>Required, min/maxlength, min & max, type, pattern (regular expression). CSS pseudo class :valid applies specific
        style to valid elements. :invalid also can helps users see if something is not valid. </p>
    <p><strong>Basic examples of how regular expression works:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>a — Matches one character that is a (not b, not aa, and so on).</li>
        <li>abc — Matches a, followed by b, followed by c.</li>
        <li>ab?c—Matches a, optionally followed by a single b, followed by c. ( ac or abc)</li>
        <li>ab*c—Matches a, optionally followed by any number of bs, followed by c. ( ac , abc, abbbbbc, and so on).
        </li>
        <li>a|b — Matches one character that is a or b.</li>
        <li>abc|xyz — Matches exactly abc or exactly xyz (but not abcxyz or a or y, and so on).</li>

    </ul>
    <p><strong>To validate a form, ask yourself a few questions:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>What kind of validation should I perform?</li>
        <li>What should I do if the form doesn't validate?</li>
        <li>How can I help the user to correct invalid data?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In order to reduce the user's frustration, it's very important to provide as much helpful information as possible
        in order to guide them in correcting their inputs. You should offer up-front suggestions so they know what's
        expected, as well as clear error messages.</p>
    <h2>USING THE FETCH API</h2>
    <p>The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as
        requests and responses. The fetch() method can optionally accept a second parameter, an init object that allows
        youn to control a number of different settings. Files can be uploaded using an HTML input type="file" multiple
        input element, FormData() and fetch(). </p>
