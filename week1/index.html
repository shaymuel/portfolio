    <h1>Week 1 Notes</h1>
    <p>This week I spent about an equal amout of time reading and doing activies.</p>
    <p>One of the activies that I worked along side with in the book was <a href="/week1/story_telling.html">the local
            storage example.</a></p>
    <p><strong>localStorage.getItem</strong></p>
    <p>Syntax: localstorage.setItem(keyName, keyValue);<br>
        When given a key name value pair, it will add the key to the storage object or
        update the key if it exsists already.</p>
    <p><strong>localStorage.setItem</strong></p>
    <p>Syntax: var aValue = storage.getItem(keyName);<br>
        When given a key name, it will return the value assigned to that key name.</p>
    <p>Local storage helps make it possible to save stuff in the browser even if the user refreshes the page. A storage
        item can also be removed if needed with Storage.removeItem().</p>
    <p><strong>Mobile First User Experience</strong></p>
    <p>Mobile design first helps to create a simple user experience for apps. There is a huge range of devices that we
        need to design for, not just the personal computer anymore. Screen real estate issues and touch interaction
        issues are major problems when not designing mobile first. Designing mobile first gives a much better experience
        across all devices and helps address issues such as touch interaction and screen real estate. Mobile first
        ensures you focus on content and functionality, "start small and scale up". Starting with the core functionality
        and working up helps make things easier to scale.

    <p>Be there, Be Useful, Be Quick, Make them not even notice. Put important things in easy to reach places. Reduce
        image usage, use SVG/web fonts, optimize and minify files, gzip to eliminate unnecessary data, Many users have
        no idea what the hamburger menu is. Having the menu at the bottom provides a better user experience. Mobile ads
        should not be taking up large parts of the screen real estate. It's important to think of simple creative ways
        to interest users with your ad. </p>
    <p><strong>Questions</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Would I only use local storage when I am not using a database?</li>
        <li>As a web developer first, how can I have more empathy for users in the applications that I am making?</li>
    </ol>
