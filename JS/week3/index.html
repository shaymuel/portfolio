    <h2>Object Method, "this"</h2>
    <p>A function that is a property of an object is called it's method.</p>
    <p>Ex : user.age() - user is the object, the method is age.</p>
    <p>To access the object, a method can use the "this" keyword and the value of "this" is the object before the dot,
        the one used to call the method. </p>
    <p>Ex. Object method needs to access information stored in the object, like a name</p>
    <p>this['refering to user'].name</p>
    <p>"this" is evalutaed during the run-time, depending on the context.</p>
    <p>A method can be accessed with a dot or ['']</p>
    <p>"This" in Javascript is "free", its value is evaluated at call-time and does not depend on where the method was
        declare, but rather on what the object is before the dot</p>
    <p>Arrow functions don't thave their own this</p>
    <p>6 Different ways where this can take on new values:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>in global context</li>
        <li>in object construction</li>
        <li>in an object method</li>
        <li>in a simple function</li>
        <li>in an arrow function</li>
        <li>this in an event listener</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ex of this in object construction:</p>
    <p>function Human (age) { <br>
        this.age = age <br>
        } <br>
        let greg = new Human(22) <br>
        let thomas = new Human(24) <br>
        console.log(greg) // this.age = 22 <br>
        console.log(thomas) // this.age = 24 <br></p>
    <p>Ex. of this in an object method:</p>
    <p>function Human (name) { <br>
        return { <br>
        name, getName() { <br>
        return this.name <br>
        }}} <br>
        const zell = new Human('Zell') <br>
        const vincy = new Human('Vincy') <br>
        console.log(zell.getName()) // Zell <br></p>
    <p>Ex of this:</p>
    <p>const dice = { <br>
        sides: 6, <br>
        roll() { <br>
        return Math.floor(this.sides * Math.random()) + 1;}} <br></p>
    <h2>Objects</h2>
    <p>If a property's value is a function, it is known as a method. An object is like a dictionary where you can look
        up a property name and see a value.</p>
    <p>Objects use curly brackets while arrays use the square objects but square brackets can be used in an object and
        the property key will be return value of the code inside the square brackets</p>
    <p>Symbols used for property keys can be used by any object that calls it. Each symbol acts as a unique values and
        avoids naming clashes if two values have the same property key</p>
    <p>Ex. Changing a property value: <br>
        superman['real name'] = 'Kal-El'; <br>
        'Kal-El' //output</p>
    <p>Ex. Objects are copied by referenece. <br>
        const thor = { name: 'Thor' <br>
        // more properties here }; <br>
        const cloneThor = thor;</p>
    <p>Any changes now made to thor will change at both places <br>
        ex. cloneThor.name = 'Clor'; <br>
        thor.name <br>
        'Clor' //output</p>
    <h2>Namespacing</h2>
    <p>To prevent naming from becoming too complex, namespacing can be used by placing all our functions inside an
        object. Then the function must first be called by the object then the property. This helps prevent names from
        being used or to keep function names more simple and organized</p>
    <h2>Random Numbers</h2>
    <p>Math.random() creates random numbers from 0 to 1. To generate a random number between 0 and 10, simply multiply
        math.random() * 10. To generate an random integer, you can use math.floor around the multiplication.</p>
    <h2>Regular Expressions</h2>
    <p>Syntax for creating a new RegExp: const pattern = new RegExp('[a-zA-Z]+ing');</p>
    <p> A sequence of characters can be represented using a " - " <br>
        ex: /[A-Z]/ <br>
        Digits: ex: /[0-9]/ <br>
        ^ negates the sequences: /[^A-Z]/ this means any characters that is not a capital <br></p>
    <p>Regular Expressions are objects and have the following properties:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Global Property: makes the pattern return all matches, by default only looks for the first occurrence of a
            match</li>
        <li>ignoreCase makes the pattern case-insensitie, default is case sensitive</li>
        <li>multiline- makes the pattern multipline, by default it stops at the end of a line</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Document Object Model</h2>
    <p>Tree-like structure of connected nodes in an HTML document. DOM is not actually part of JavaScript, it is
        language agnostic, but in Javascript we can access this part of the web by using the built in object called
        document.</p>
    <p>The DOM stores whitespace that is in the html document as text nodes as well.</p>
    <h3>DOM Methods</h3>
    <p>.nodeType tells what type of node it is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Result 1: element</li>
        <li>Result 2: attribute</li>
        <li>Result 3: text</li>
        <li>Result 8: comment</li>
        <li>Result 9: body</li>
    </ul>
    <p>.nodeName - finds the name of the element</p>
    <h3>Legacy DOM Shortcut Methods</h3>
    <p>Document.body, Document.images, Document.links, Document.anchors, Document.forms.</p>
    <p>Other properties: document.images[0], has .length</p>
    <p>Nodes are array like objects but they are not arrays. Use the spread operator to turn a DOM object into an array.
    </p>
    <h3>Navigating the DOM</h3>
    <p><strong>childNodes</strong> is a list of all the nodes that are children of the node concerned.<br>
        <strong>children property</strong> returns any nodes that are children of that node<br>
        <strong>firstChild</strong> returns the first child of a node <br>
        <strong>lastChild</strong> returns the last child of a node <br>
        <strong>nextSibling property</strong> returns the next adjacent node of the same parent
        <strong>previousSibiling</strong> returns the previous adjacent node
    </p>
    <h4>Creating a Text Node</h4>
    <p>document.createTextNode() takes a paramenter which is a string containing the text that goes into the node</p>
    <h3>Appending Nodes</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Create the element node</li>
        <li>Create the text node</li>
        <li>Append the text node to the element node</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Functions to Create Elements</h4>
    <p>Create a function with everyting you want to add into the DOM, the call the function with the parameters added of
        what you want to show up in the DOM</p>
    <h2>Events</h2>
    <p>Javascript uses non-blocking apprach that uses event listens to listen out for any clicks on the page. Event
        listeners are added to elements on the page and are part of the DOM. Inline event handlers are best to be
        avoided.</p>
    <h3>Event Listeners</h3>
    <p>addEventLintener() is called on a node object</p>
    <p>Parenthesis should not be placed after the function when it's used as the argument to an event listeners;
        otherwise the fucntion will actually be called when the event listener is set, instead of when the event happens
    </p>
    <p>Ex: function doSomething(){ <br>
        console.log('Something Happened!');} <br>
        addEventListener('click', doSomething);</p>
    <h4>Event Object</h4>
    <p>
        <strong>Type property</strong> tells us the type of event <br>
        <strong>Event property</strong> returns a reference tot he node that fired the event
        <strong>ScreenX&Y, clientX&Y, pageX&Y</strong> help identify where something happened on the page
    </p>
    <h4>Mouse Events</h4>
    <p>click, mousedown, mouseup, dblclick, mouseover, mouseout, mousemove, keydown, keypress, keyup</p>
    <h4>Touch Events
    </h4>
    <p>touchstart, touchend, touchend, touchmove, touchcenter, touchleave, touchcancel</p>
    <h4>Removing Event Listeners</h4>
    <p>This can be useful so that events that don't need to don't happen over and over again</p>
    <h4>Event Propagation</h4>
    <p><strong>Bubbling - </strong>when the even fires on the element clicked on first the bubbles up the document tree,
        firing an event on each parent element until it reaches the root node, this is the default</p>
    <p><strong>Capturing -</strong>starts by firing an event on the root element then propagates downwards firing an
        even on each child element until it reaches the target element that was clicked on
    </p>

    <h2>Questions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Are there any good resources to learn more about OOP?</li>
        <li>Are regular expressions used for anything else besides comparisons?</li>
    </ol>
